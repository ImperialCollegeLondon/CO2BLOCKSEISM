# CO2BLOCKSEISM
An analytical tool for screening subsurface CO<sub>2</sub> storage resources constrained by induced seismicity

CO2BLOCKSEISM extends the tool [CO2BLOCK](https://github.com/co2block/CO2BLOCK), which estimates and optimizes CO<sub>2</sub> storage capacity subject to reservoir injectivity limitations. To learn more about the theory behind CO2BLOCKSEISM, please refer to the following paper:

The CO2BLOCKSEISM tool is provided here in the context of two demonstration studies: [Oklahoma seismicity](https://github.com/imanrahimzadeh/CO2BLOCKSEISM/tree/main/Oklahoma%20seismicity) and [Utsira storage capacity](https://github.com/imanrahimzadeh/CO2BLOCKSEISM/tree/main/Utsira%20storage%20capacity).
