# CO2BLOCKSEISM
An analytical tool for screening subsurface CO2 storage resources constrained by induced seismicity

CO2BLOCKSEISM extends the tool [CO2BLOCK](https://github.com/co2block/CO2BLOCK), which estimates and optimizes CO<sub>2</sub> storage capacity subject to reservoir injectivity limitations â€Ž
The code is provided here in the context of two demonstration studies:
